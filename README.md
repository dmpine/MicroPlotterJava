This is just the repository with the source files. You can download the software from this link.

Alternatively, if you have some knowledge on java, know that the distribution files are located inside the dist folder. You can use that too. However, I recommend downloading the software from the link provided above since that file contains additional information and detailed documentation.

MicroPlotter is a simple data plotting and recording tool written in java, hence, it works in all operating systems. It has been compiled under java 8 for major compatibility and older devices can also take advantage of this application. If you need a tool to monitor and record data from say, a PIC microcontroler, an Arduino board, an ESP board or even a Raspberry Pi, you can use this software.

Here you can see a screen capture of MicroPlotter working:

As you can see, there are several options designed to facilitate your work when you need to visualize and record your data. I recommend reading the documentation that comes with the sofware.
