Link to download ---> Here <---. Please continue reading.

(Alternatively, if you have some knowledge on java, know that the distribution files are located inside the dist folder as is usual. You can use those too. However, I recommend downloading the software from the link provided above since that file contains additional information and detailed documentation).

MicroPlotter is a simple data plotting and recording tool written in java, hence, it works in all operating systems. It has been compiled under java 8 for major compatibility and older devices can also take advantage of this application (and it is <5Mb!). Give life to an old PC and re-purpose it as a data recording tool! For instance, look at the following image:

As you can see, you don't need the best computer to run this program. If you just need a tool to monitor and record data from say, a PIC microcontroler, an Arduino board, an ESP board or even a Raspberry Pi, you can use this software. Here you can see a screen capture of MicroPlotter working on a different operating system:

As you can see, there are several options designed to facilitate your work when you need to visualize and record your data. It supports up to 9 columns for plotting, however, on the terminal you can have more columns. If you need more, you can always run several instances of this program. I recommend reading the documentation that comes with the sofware.

This software was possible thanks to the popular libraries jSerialComm and jfreechart!
